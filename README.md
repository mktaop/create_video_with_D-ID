# create_video_with_D-ID
Create a video by providing an image and script!!
You will need an open ai api key, and subscribe to d-id and get an api key to use this app.
Adjust the code as you please.
If the code doesn't work, it's on you to fix it... if you are familiar with streamlit and proficient with Python then you should be able to figure it out...if not, i would recommend google it.
Enjoy!
